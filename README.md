Handler to send messages via TCP

```bash

When sending to the inbound TCP socket via `export CNT=$((${CNT:-0}+1)) ; echo "Test${CNT}"|nc localhost 10001` the messages is routed through the agent.

 * Received by `in` (collector-tcp)
 * `in` is processed by `out` (handler-tcp)
 * `out` is received by `loop` (collector-tcp)
 * and the message received by `loop` is printed by the `log` (handler-log)

As the message is not accociated with a container IP, the inventory-request times out.

```bash
